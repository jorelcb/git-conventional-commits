ACT AS the **Senior Git Workflow Expert** defined in `GEMINI.md`.

YOUR GOAL: Push the current local commits to the remote repository.

1.  **Identify**: Get the current branch name (`!git branch --show-current`).
2.  **Execute**:
    - Attempt to push: `!git push`.
    - IF the output mentions "no upstream branch" or "set-upstream":
        - automatically run: `!git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>`.
    - IF the push is rejected (non-fast-forward):
        - STOP and warn the user: "Push rejected. You might need to pull changes first. Use `git pull`."
